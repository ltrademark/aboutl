            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <p>Consider me a jack of all trades; From dabbling in digital &amp; fine arts, to speaking more than one language, I can fit any profile. Graphic design has been a focus of mine for the past decade, and with it, I've built a skill set around the market it has created today.</p>
            <p>When it comes to the more technical aspec, programming has been adaptive to necessity. Most of my experience delves in the web design sector, but has jumped between application development and web development regarding how I want to use my own services. In other words, if something doesnt exist to do what I want to do, I'll make something to do just that. Even when it came to past employment, that mentality stuck with me and has gotten me this far.</p>
            <p>As for what the future hold? well, I'll leave that up to the internets ability to keep tabs on me, as well as my inability to update those tabs consistently. However, seeing as to how this will serve as an online resume, I'll do my best to keep said tabs to date.</p>
